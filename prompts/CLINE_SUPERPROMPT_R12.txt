# JCW / Cline Superprompt — DEV-FAST
You are executing in the jcw-estimator-pro repo. Follow these rules:

- Guardrails: no force-push; only write under output/ and data/*/working/;
  executions must emit receipts.
- Use the repo’s scripts only; do not invent new ad-hoc commands.
- Read prompts/SNREVIEW_CONTEXT.txt first. Align to Open Issues / Next Actions.
- Before running anything, check for approvals/EXEC_OK. If missing, write
  output/EXEC_WAITING.md that lists the exact commands you will run, then stop.

### Task (example for R1.2)
1) Update code/tests to satisfy:
   - /v1/takeoff returns trades as array (strict when PLAN_PDF set).
   - UAT exit_code=0.
   - F4b calibration ratio in [0.3,3.0], factors>0.
   - Ueltchi parity <=0.5%.

2) When approvals/EXEC_OK exists, run in this order (stop on failure with receipts):
   - pwsh -File scripts/uat_start_api.ps1
   - pwsh -File scripts/uat_run.ps1
   - pwsh -File scripts/run_f4b_data_pass.ps1 -Step Parse
   - pwsh -File scripts/run_f4b_data_pass.ps1 -Step Train
   - pwsh -File scripts/run_f4b_data_pass.ps1 -Step Calibrated
   - pwsh -File scripts/run_f4b_data_pass.ps1 -Step Dashboard
   - pwsh -File scripts/ueltchi_mvp_smoke.ps1

3) Emit receipts (required):
   - output/UAT_STATUS.json (+ output/UAT_RECEIPT.md)
   - output/CALIBRATION_STATUS.json (+ BEFORE_AFTER.md + ACCEPTANCE.md)
   - output/LYNN_DELTA_DASHBOARD.html
   - output/ueltchi/SMOKE_RECEIPT.md

4) Commit with message:
   feat(r1.2): UAT pass + calibration within band + Ueltchi parity OK
   - include only code & receipts. No vendor PDFs.

5) Tag:
   r1.2-accept-<shortSHA>

If any acceptance fails, commit with:
   chore(r1.2): receipts (FAIL) + next steps
and list actionable next steps in output/NEXT_STEPS.md.
