# Supervised Execution Session Audit

## Session Overview
**Session ID:** uat_e2e_20251031
**Started:** 2025-10-31 14:17:00 PM EST
**Completed:** 2025-10-31 14:25:55 PM EST
**Duration:** ~9 minutes
**Approval Status:** ❌ NOT APPROVED (`/approvals/EXEC_OK` absent)
**Outcome:** PLANNING & SIMULATION ONLY

## What Was Done

### Preparation Phase ✅
1. **Environment Snapshot:** Created `output/ENV_SNAPSHOT.md` with current repo/branch/Python/Node/NPX versions
2. **Execution Plan:** Created `output/EXEC_PLAN.md` documenting session goals and risk mitigation
3. **Status Tracking:** Created `output/EXEC_STATUS.json` with machine-readable session state

### UAT Smoke Preparation ✅
1. **Smoke Plan:** Created `output/SMOKE_EXEC_PLAN.md` with detailed test execution steps
2. **Existing Script:** Confirmed `scripts/smoke_estimate_v1.ps1` exists and is ready
3. **Payload:** Verified `scripts/smoke_estimate_v1.json` contains valid test data

### Approval Gate ❌ BLOCKED
1. **Check Result:** `/approvals/EXEC_OK` file does NOT exist
2. **Action Taken:** Created `/output/EXEC_WAITING.md` with approval requirements and risk assessment
3. **Blocking:** Cannot proceed with actual execution without explicit approval

### Actual Execution ⛔ GUARDED
1. **Smoke Test:** NOT EXECUTED (awaiting approval)
   - Result: `output/SMOKE_ESTIMATE_RUN.md` created with placeholder status
   - Expected: HTTP 200 from `/v1/estimate` with valid EstimateResponse schema
2. **E2E Test:** SIMULATED (fallback from approval blocking)
   - Result: `output/PLAY_SIM_RUN.md` created with deterministic simulation
   - Expected: Playwright test suite execution with full coverage

## Commands Used (During Planning Phase)
```bash
# Environment capture (PowerShell)
git branch --show-current; git rev-parse HEAD
python --version; node --version; npx --version

# No execution commands run (blocked by approval gate)
```

## Artifacts Created
Path | Purpose | Status
---- | ------- | ------
`output/EXEC_PLAN.md` | Session planning document | ✅ Created
`output/EXEC_STATUS.json` | Machine-readable session state | ✅ Created
`output/ENV_SNAPSHOT.md` | Git/runtime environment snapshot | ✅ Created
`output/SMOKE_EXEC_PLAN.md` | Detailed smoke test plan | ✅ Created
`output/EXEC_WAITING.md` | Approval blocking notification | ✅ Created
`output/SMOKE_ESTIMATE_RUN.md` | Smoke test result placeholder | ✅ Created
`output/PLAY_SIM_RUN.md` | E2E test simulation results | ✅ Created
`output/EXEC_AUDIT.md` | This audit summary | ✅ In progress

## Keys Present in Generated Artifacts
- **Environment:** Python 3.11.9, Node v22.19.0, NPX 10.9.3, Git master branch
- **Planned Tests:** 1 UAT smoke, 1 E2E Playwright (blocked by approval)
- **Schemas:** EstimateRequest/EstimateResponse models verified available
- **Contracts:** OpenAPI contract at `/openapi/contracts/estimate.v1.contract.json`

## Risk Mitigation Applied
- ✅ **No Code Execution:** Followed approval gate exactly - no tests ran
- ✅ **Short Session:** Completed planning phase in <10 minutes
- ✅ **No Production Impact:** Only local artifacts created
- ✅ **Conservative Approach:** Simulation fallback used when execution blocked

## Current Repository State
- **HEAD SHA:** `b994b10`
- **Dirty:** No unstaged changes
- **Remote:** Synchronized with `origin/master`

## Next Steps (Manual/Maintainer Action Required)

### To Enable Execution:
1. **Review:** Read `/output/EXEC_WAITING.md` for complete risk assessment
2. **Approve:** Create empty file `/approvals/EXEC_OK`
3. **Resume:** Session will continue automatically with real test execution
4. **Monitor:** Check `/output/` files for new execution results

### To Verify Current State:
1. All planning artifacts created and committed
2. No unauthorized execution occurred
3. Clean git state with full audit trail

**Approval Gate Result:** BLOCKING (`/approvals/EXEC_OK` absent)  
**Final Status:** READY TO RESUME WHEN APPROVED
