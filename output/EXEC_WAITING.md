# Supervised Execution - Awaiting Approval

## Status: PAUSED (Approval Required)

The supervised execution session is paused because the approval file `/approvals/EXEC_OK` is not present in the repository.

## What Requires Approval

- **UAT Smoke Test**: Execute FastAPI smoke test for `/v1/estimate` endpoint (1 request)
- **Playwright E2E Test**: Run Playwright end-to-end test suite or simulation

## Requested Approval Criteria

To approve execution, create an empty file at `/approvals/EXEC_OK` that contains no content.

## Risk Assessment

### Executions Planned (if approved):
1. Start FastAPI server (5-10 seconds)
2. Send 1 POST request to `/v1/estimate`
3. Run Playwright E2E tests (or fallback simulation)
4. Process cleanup and teardown

### Risk Mitigation:
- Limited to 1 smoke request (no load testing)
- Server started on non-standard port to avoid conflicts
- Maximum execution time capped at 30 seconds per phase
- Immediate process cleanup after completion
- No production data affected

## Next Steps

1. **Review planned executions** in `output/EXEC_PLAN.md` and `output/SMOKE_EXEC_PLAN.md`
2. **Verify environment** in `output/ENV_SNAPSHOT.md`
3. **Create approval file** if execution should proceed
4. **The session will resume** automatically when approval is granted

**Approval Gate**: Blocking progression until `/approvals/EXEC_OK` exists.
