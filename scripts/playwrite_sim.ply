# JCW Estimator Pro – Playwright Simulation Plan (NO-RUN DOCUMENT)
# Purpose: Human-readable steps for a baseline E2E pass against local UI
# Mode: Plan only – do not install, do not execute

SET UI_BASE_URL = env:UI_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:8000"
SET FRONTEND_ENTRY = "web/frontend/index.html"
SET PDF_PATH = "C:\\Users\\natha\\OneDrive\\Aquisition Lab\\Deals\\JC Welton\\Post Day 1 Ops\\Estimating\\Lynn\\251020_291 SOD - Building Permit Set.pdf"

PLAN:
  1. Launch browser (headed/CI neutral) → open ${UI_BASE_URL} OR file://${FRONTEND_ENTRY}
  2. Verify header shows "AI-Powered Cost Estimation & Blueprint Analysis"
  3. Switch to "Manual Entry" tab:
     - Fill #area = 5000
     - Select #projectType = "residential"
     - Select #quality = "standard"
     - Select #complexity = "moderate"
     - Bedrooms #bedrooms = 0 ; Bathrooms #bathrooms = 0
     - Submit form (button with calculator icon)
  4. Wait for results panel (#resultsSection.show)
     - Expect #totalCost to be non-$0
     - Capture #hardCosts, #softCosts, #costPerSf text
  5. Switch to "AI Blueprint Analysis":
     - Choose file (PDF_PATH)
     - DO NOT press “Analyze with AI” (no network/compute); just assert file name shows
  6. Save DOM snapshot and text content of results and write into /output/PLAYWRIGHT_PLAN_SNAPSHOT.md (Cline must write file; human will review/commit)

GUARDS:
  - No network calls, no installs, no test runs. Plan only.
  - Treat Cloud Run as stale; use only local UI structure observed in the repo.
  - Use selectors consistent with index.html (#area, #projectType, #quality, #complexity, #bedrooms, #bathrooms, #resultsSection, #totalCost, #hardCosts, #softCosts).
